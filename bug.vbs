Function to check if a number is within a range in VBScript:

```vbscript
Function IsWithinRange(number, min, max)
  If number >= min And number <= max Then
    IsWithinRange = True
  Else
    IsWithinRange = False
  End If
End Function
```

**Bug:** The function works correctly for positive numbers but fails with negative numbers because of implicit type conversion. For instance, if `min` is -10 and `number` is -20, the comparison `number >= min` would evaluate to `True` because VBScript converts the values to their positive counterpart when comparing them which is not the intended behavior. 

This is a subtle error as many users would expect the comparison to work correctly across the whole number line without needing explicit type conversion, leading to unexpected results in cases involving negative numbers.
